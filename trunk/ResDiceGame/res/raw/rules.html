<h3>The Basics</h3>
The game map depicts the Island of Catan, with special symbols for settlements,
cities, roads, and knights. During the course of the game, you try to build as 
many roads, settlements, cities, and knights as possible on the island depicted
on your game map.

<h3>Game Play</h3>
During each turn, you roll the dice up to three times. After every roll, you may tap on 
any dice to keep them from being rolled. 
After three rolls (or sooner if you are ready to build with the resources you have),
tap a highlighted road, settlement, city or knight to build it. Building will automatically
use up the resources required. You may build multiple times during your turn, if you have rolled
enough of the appropriate resources.

<h3>Building Rules</h3>

Road: A road costs 1 brick and 1 lumber and is always worth 1 point. The first road
(starting road) is already built and doesn’t cost any resources. Roads are built in a
sequence, meaning that a new road must be built next to a road that has already
been built. A city or settlement next to a road does not obstruct subsequent road
building — this also applies if the settlement or city hasn’t yet been built.

Settlement: A settlement costs 1 lumber, 1 brick, 1 grain, and 1 wool. 
A settlement can only be built if an already built road is next to it. Furthermore,
settlements must be built following the sequence of their points: first the settlement
with 3 points must be built, then the settlement with 4 points, and so on. 

City: A city costs 3 ore and 2 grain. The procedure is the same as for building a
settlement. A city can only be built if it is next to an already built road. Cities must
also be built following the sequence of their points.

Knight: A knight costs 1 grain, 1 wool, and 1 ore. The knights must also be built
following the sequence of their points. Each knight that you build has a resource
below it — you may use each such resource once per game.

<h3>Knight Guarded Resources</h3>
For each knight you build, you may use (once during the game) the resource
below this knight. This resource is used automatically when needed.

* Note that this is handled differently in the Android version of the game than in 
the regular game, where these "Resource Jokers" are used to change dice rolls, not used
as separate resources.

<h3>Gold Trade</h3>
If you have 2 gold results after you finish rolling the dice, those 2 gold can be traded
for another resource when building. Thus 2 gold will be treated as 1 ore, 1 brick, or 1 
of any other resource. 

<h3>End of the Game</h3>
The game ends after 15 turns. The total score is the sum of all turns, with 2 points
subtracted for each turn where no points were scored (shown by an 'X').
